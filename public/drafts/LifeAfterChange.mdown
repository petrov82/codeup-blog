Life After Change


#Life After Change

	When I first signed up for the 12-week programming bootcamp, I was pretty sure *something* wouldn't pan out. They were looking for a "certain kind of person" to be in the first cohort. I was working part-time in retail at the time and was not really sure if i had a soul any more.
	Did I qualify as a person?
	They also wanted gobs of money ($7430 at the time).
	I had very little money.
